            <p>We are Whitney Stock Exchange, a newly-established club at Whitney High School that strives to teach our peers the fundamentals of investing and managing their finances. Although these are things that are rarely taught to students, these are skills that everyone needs to know, and we have taken the endeavor to teach our peers while teaching ourselves as well. Our first priority is to give each club member a basic understanding of the economy and investing. These will be done through brief presentations in the beginning of each meeting as to not bore our club members while teaching them essential information at the same time. After club members have a basic understanding of terms, concepts, and strategies, they can apply it in a variety of ways. As students who donâ€™t need to manage their own finances yet, they can still use the newly-acquired knowledge to better understand the news, especially news on money and business. Such understanding will ensure that students are responsible citizens that understand and know what is happening in the world around them. Students can also use the basic information and apply it to our MarketWatch competition, which is a simulated trading game for club members to participate in. Once club members have a good understanding of how to invest, they can join our team(s) of seven individuals that will compete in the OTIS competition run by the University of Pennsylvania. You may have noticed a trend among our goals. The trend is how we hope that students will be inspired by what they learn and ultimately open up their own real stock account and begin investing or just continue to learn more on their own in general. Doing these two things will not just benefit in the short-term; it will give students a lifelong advantage over many other people. We are a club with big ambitions, and we hope you will support us.
                <br />
                We want to teach students to prepare for their adult lives ahead.
                <br />
