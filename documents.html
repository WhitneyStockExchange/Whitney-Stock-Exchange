          We know that some of you guys were not able to attend the meeting due to other commitments, so we need to update you guys on what happened. During the meeting, we went over the goals of this club, how to use the MarketWatch interface, the major aspects of the UPenn OTIS tournament, some details about the Ithaca College Competition, and finally an overview of future meetings and the curriculum that we will teach in those meetings. Find attached below the slideshow that we covered in the meeting, which will cover all of the material listed above. For any questions, feel free to contact Bryant, Janmesh, or me. Also, please fill out the form attached below if you are interested in competing in the UPenn OTIS tournament. Please make sure that you can handle the significant amount of time and dedication that is required for competing, as we really want to rank nationally this year. We only have room for two groups of seven for the UPenn OTIS tournament this year, so we need the most dedicated individuals and no prior knowledge of stocks is required (just a desire to learn!). Some of the major dates for the UPenn OTIS competition are on the slides, so make sure your other activities do not overlap with those meeting dates. All in all, it was amazing to see a lot of you guys show up and express your enthusiasm, which motivates us to make your time in this club as efficient and enjoyable as possible!
